# Alignment

As an aligned CC holder, you hold governance authority in the Cascadia ecosystem. This means you have the right to vote on proposals and influence protocol development.



**Step 1: Connect your Wallet.**

Click on the "Connect My Wallet" button.

Follow the prompts to connect your preferred wallet.\

**Step 2: Align CC to Receive bCC.**\

Determine the amount of CC you want to align.  You can select 25%, 50%, 75%, the maximum amount of your available balance, or enter a custom number.

Click the "Approve" button to confirm your selection to initiate the alignment process.

Your bCC balance will update to reflect your new alignment.

**Step 3: Check Alignment and Realigning.**

You can check your level of alignment at any time on the dashboard.  Here you'll see the amount of bCC you currently hold and your alignment as a percentage total bCC.  If you wish to re-affirm your alignment, you can click on the "Realign" button.\

# VeTokenomics

Vote-escrowed tokenomics (veTokenomics) is a mechanism introduced by CurveDAO. Users are incentivized to lock or align their tokens for a specified duration. Cascadia refers to this process as alignment. During the alignment process, regular tokens, like Cascadia's native CC gas token, become vote-escrowed tokens (bCC).

This alignment isn't just a one-time action. You have the flexibility to adjust your level of commitment, deciding how much of your token holdings you're willing to align for a longer term.

The core idea is to incentivize stability within the network. When you align your tokens, you're making a pledge not to sell or transfer them for a certain period, which helps ensures a steady user base. As a result, the network becomes more resilient and secure.

Aligned tokens aren't just idle. They serve a crucial function in network governance. More specifically, with Cascadia's bCC you get a say in important decisions shaping the network's future, aligning the network's development with the interests of every participant.



**What are the benefits?**

Aligning tokens in a veTokenomics model presents several advantages:

1. **Long-Term Rewards:** The system is designed to reward patience and long-term commitment. The longer you align your tokens, the greater benefits you can accrue, which may include a higher yield or more tokens over time.
2. **Governance Participation:** Aligned tokens, like bCC in Cascadia, often confer voting rights, enabling holders to participate in the on-chain governance. This democratic process allows all participants to contribute to key decisions regarding the project's future.
3. **Flexibility:** Cascadia's alignment process isn't rigid. Users can decide the extent of their alignment based on their comfort level, aligning anything from a fraction to all of their total holdings.

bCC token holders, in exchange for a share of the benefits from the ecosystem's performance, manage Cascadiaâ€™s resources. Holding bCC grants holders the right to:

* Receive network gas fees.
* Receive token emissions.
* Receive fees from native protocols (nProtocols).
* Vote on gauge distribution for nProtocols and future blockchain development.
* Engage in participatory tokenomics activities.



**What are the drawbacks?**

Despite its advantages, veTokenomics comes with certain challenges:

1. **Token Liquidity:** Once you align your tokens, they're not immediately available for transactions. You'll have to wait until the alignment period ends, which could be a limitation for users needing liquidity.
2. **Market Volatility:** The value of your tokens might fluctuate during the alignment period. If the token's value decreases, your aligned tokens could be worth less when they're finally available.
3. **Complexity for New Users:** VeTokenomics, with its unique alignment and cooldown processes, can be complex for new users to understand, potentially creating a barrier to entry.

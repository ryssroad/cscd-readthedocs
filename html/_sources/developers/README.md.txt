# Developers

Verifying smart contracts is a critical process which ensures the legitimacy, safety, and proper functioning of these digital agreements.  By applying verification, you ensure that your contracts are not only well-structured but also secure from potential vulnerabilities.

We will outline two prominent methods for this verification: using the [Cascadia Block Explorer](https://explorer.cascadia.foundation/) and the [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) development environment.

Our Block Explorer is an intuitive online tool that allows for quick and easy verification of smart contracts.  It's user-friendly interface and streamlined design ensures accessibility even for those new to smart contracts.

In contrast, Hardhat provides a more comprehensive platform for smart contract creation and verification.  As an Ethereum-based environment, it offers robust tools and integrations, favoring users seeking a more customizable approach.

# CosmWasm

CosmWasm bridges the world of smart contracts and leverages WebAssembly (Wasm) to offer a modular and adaptable environment for developers. Visit [https://cosmwasm.cascadia.foundation/](https://cosmwasm.cascadia.foundation/).

Some of the main features that distinguish it:

1. **Modularity:** Easily integrate smart contracting capabilities.
2. **Rust-Centric:** While it's optimized for Rust, it has the potential to adopt more languages.
3. **Practicality:** Contract deployment and execution is easier for developers.

# Principles

Being a validator requires more than adhering to instructions.  It presents a challenging yet rewarding opportunity to explore decentralization.  It's vital to have a firm understanding of network administration and the ability to resolve technical issues that may arise.



**Basic Principles to Become a Validator**

1. Validators must run the most up-to-date version of Cascadia software.
2. Validators must ensure their servers are accessible and private keys are secure.
3. Validators must actively participate in governance.
4. Validators are expected to be active within the community and be aware of Cascadia's state to quickly adapt to any changes.

# Smart Contracts

This section serves as a primer to the foundational concepts of CosmWasm Smart Contracts. The following sections are instructions addressing the following:

* Environment setup
* Deploying a smart contract on the testnet
* Managing smart contract functions using the CLI
* Tweaking an existing contract

\
The intentional design of the following guide is to provide a seamless start, keeping the intricacies of development for subsequent sections.

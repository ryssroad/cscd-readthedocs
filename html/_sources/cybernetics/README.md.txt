# Cybernetics

Cybernetics is a transdisciplinary branch of mathematics studying the behavior of dynamic systems. Derived from the Greek word, kubernḗtēs, meaning pilot or steersman, the term cybernetics was first used in 1948 by American mathematician Norbert Wiener to describe the newly established science of command and control in animals and machines.  Cybernetics is applied by Cascadia in its approach to [incentive](incentives.md) design.

Cybernetics suggests that the world is composed of constantly changing loops of information.  Cascadia shall implement two types of feedback loops.  One loop will make adjustments based on observation of the system’s output, enabling learning.  The other will recognize environmental changes and replace obsolete information in the system with new data, enabling evolution.

By adopting cybernetic design, Cascadia gains the following characteristics:

* Mutuality: Users interact cooperatively, creating multiple simultaneous interactions among its subsystems.
* Evolvability: Cascadia does not develop through top-down planning but rather through ground-up, opportunistic measures.
* Reflexivity: Cascadia is rich in internal and external feedback, both negative and positive, leading to reflexive phenomena such as self-organization, self-production, and self-regulation.

The aim of a cybernetic system is not to maintain the status quo but rather to be adaptable enough to deal with the novel and unexpected.  Cascadia has adopted cybernetics on both our infrastructure level and our application level to become an extremely adaptive, extremely responsive network.

# Business Development and Marketing

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Cascadia Deck_Page_14.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Companies have issues attracting users. Millions are spent each year on legacy marketing agencies or outdated practices, like indiscriminate airdrops. Cascadia empowers any individual to act as a marketing agent through dynamic smart contracts, which gauge the effectiveness, reach, and sentiment of a userâ€™s social media posts about a project. High quality interactions are incentivized through permissionless token claims. The market opportunity here is tremendous. Disrupting the digital marketing industry by returning sovereignty to individuals has far-reaching implications both inside and outside of web3.

Users, not platforms, should own their personal data.

<h1>Disclosure Policy<a class="headerlink" href="#disclosure-policy" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Cascadia’s security practices are based on the National Cyber Security Centre’s Vulnerability Disclosure Toolkit for public organizations. This vulnerability disclosure policy applies to any vulnerabilities you are considering reporting to Cascadia. </p>
<p>We recommend reading this vulnerability disclosure policy fully before you report a vulnerability and acting in compliance with it. We value those who take the time and effort to report security vulnerabilities according to this policy.</p>
<p><strong>Reporting</strong></p>
<p>If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please submit your report to us at contact&#64;cascadia.foundation.</p>
<p>In your report please include the following details or follow the attached <a class="reference external" href="https://www.cascadia.foundation/file/sample.pdf">sample</a>.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The website, IP, page, or location where the vulnerability can be observed.</p></li>
<li><p>A brief description of the type of vulnerability.</p></li>
<li><p>It is important to ensure that they are benign, non-destructive, proof-of-concept actions. </p></li>
</ol>
<p>{% hint style=”info” %}
This approach enables faster and more accurate triaging of reports, while also reducing the likelihood of duplicate reports or malicious exploitation of the identified vulnerabilities.
{% endhint %}</p>
<p><strong>What to Expect</strong> </p>
<p>After you have submitted your report, we will respond to your report within 5 working days and aim to triage your report within 10 working days. We’ll also aim to keep you informed of our progress. Priority for remediation is assessed by looking at the impact, severity, and exploitation complexity. Vulnerability reports might take some time to triage or address. You are welcome to enquire about the status but should avoid doing so more than once every 14 days. </p>
<p>This allows our teams to focus on the remediation. We will notify you when the reported vulnerability is remediated, and you may be invited to confirm that the solution covers the vulnerability adequately. Once your vulnerability has been resolved, we welcome requests to disclose your report. We’d like to unify guidance to affected users, so please continue to coordinate the public release with us.</p>
<p><strong>Guidance</strong> </p>
<p>You must not:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Break any applicable law or regulations</p></li>
<li><p>Access unnecessary, excessive, or significant amounts of data.</p></li>
<li><p>Modify data in Cascadia’s systems or services.</p></li>
<li><p>Use high-intensity invasive or destructive scanning tools to find vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Attempt or report any form of denial of service.</p></li>
<li><p>Disrupt Cascadia’s services or systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Submit reports detailing non-exploitable vulnerabilities, or reports indicating that the services do not fully align with “best practice”, for example missing security headers.</p></li>
<li><p>Communicate any vulnerabilities or associated details other than by means described in the published security.txt.</p></li>
<li><p>Social engineer, phish, or physically attack Cascadia’s staff or infrastructure.</p></li>
<li><p>Demand financial compensation in order to disclose any vulnerabilities.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You must**:**</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Always comply with data protection rules and must not violate the privacy of Cascadia’s users, staff, contractors, services or systems. You must not, for example, share, redistribute or fail to properly secure data retrieved from the systems or services.</p></li>
<li><p>Securely delete all data retrieved during your research as soon as it is no longer required or within 1 month of the vulnerability being resolved, whichever occurs first (or as otherwise required by data protection law).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Legalities</strong> </p>
<p>This policy is designed to be compatible with common vulnerability disclosure good practices. It does not give you permission to act in any manner that is inconsistent with the law, or which might cause Cascadia or partner entities to be in breach of any legal obligations.</p>

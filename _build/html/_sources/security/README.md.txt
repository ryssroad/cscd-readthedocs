# Security

Ensuring the safety and security of our users is a top priority. We're committed to providing a reliable and secure platform to interact with. In this section, we will outline the various measures we have taken to ensure the highest level of security for our users.



**Regular Audits**

To ensure the ongoing security and stability of our platform, Cascadia undergoes security audits by reputable third-party providers.  These audits assess our smart contracts, codebase, and network infrastructure, ensuring that we maintain the highest security standards and address any potential vulnerabilities proactively.



**User Account Protection**

Cascadia takes user account security very seriously. We recommend users employ strong, unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) to protect their accounts. Additionally, we store sensitive user data using encryption techniques and industry-standard best practices for data storage.



**Best Practices**

To ensure the security of your assets and personal information, we recommend that you follow these best practices:

1. Use a strong, unique password for your account and update it regularly.
2. Enable 2FA for added security.
3. Be cautious of phishing attempts and only interact with official Cascadia channels.
4. Regularly update your device's operating system, browser, and other software.
5. Maintain secure backups of your private keys and other sensitive information.



By following these guidelines and utilizing Cascadia's security features, you can help ensure a safe and secure experience for yourself and the entire community.

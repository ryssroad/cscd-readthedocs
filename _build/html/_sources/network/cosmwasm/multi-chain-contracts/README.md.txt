# Multi-Chain Contracts

CosmWasm offers multi-chain smart contracts, which means one contract can run on multiple blockchains In addition, CosmWasm contracts remain chain-agnostic which is why Cascadia adopts it. Once written for the first time, they can be deployed on other chains.

Cascadia uses CosmWasm's design, which is compact, with the flexibility to support various programming languages and integrate into different frameworks, making it an efficient and versatile tool for cross-chain contract deployment.

It allows trustless inter-chain messaging. Contracts can send messages to other chains securely without awaiting a response, eliminating common pitfalls like race conditions.

In essence, with CosmWasm, developers get a versatile platform ensuring their contracts remain adaptable and interconnected across any network.

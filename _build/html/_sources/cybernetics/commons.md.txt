In 1908, Garett Harding proposed the concept of The Catastrophe of Shared Resources, which described how within a communal resource system, individuals pursuing their own advantage act against the collective benefit, ultimately depleting the shared resource.  Cascadia has the potential to resolve this issue by fostering interdependent restraint among interacting parties.  This leads to a necessity-driven system that synchronizes the motivations of all participants.

Historically, when faced with the challenge of shared resources, local groups and communities have often been able to devise sophisticated approaches to manage communal assets beyond government regulation and private property systems, provided the right local circumstances.  In a self-regulated cybernetic network, the appropriate institutional arrangements pertain to the utilization of shared resource pools.  In the domain of new institutional economics, organizations consist of formal (e.g., legislation, agreements, authority) and informal (e.g., standards, habits, traditions) social structures that direct human actions.  Shared resource pools, therefore, represent the intricate regulations that control individual usage of these shared resources. A neo-cybernetic oversight mechanism ensures the observation of activities related to the use of shared resource pools and resolves disputes between parties.

At its essence, cybernetics embodies a call to action.  It represents what Pickering refers to as an ontology of transformation.  We strive to develop these systems to collaborate with stakeholders, explore social and artificial intelligence, and harmonize blockchain participants through mathematical frameworks.

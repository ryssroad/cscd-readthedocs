**Step 1: Sign**

**Choosing Your Message**: Determine what you'd like to sign. This could be numeric, alphanumeric, or a specific text.

**Sign with Private Key**: Enter your chosen message, and the platform will use your private key for signing.&#x20;

This will prompt a request. No fees apply here, you're just using your private key to sign a message.
{% endhint %}

**Retrieve Your Signature**: Once the message is signed, Cascadia will provide the corresponding signature.

**Share Your Signature**: With this signature, you can communicate with others, allowing them to verify the signed message.



**Step 2: Verification**

To confirm a message, you'll need the:

* Signer's Address
* Signed Message
* Message's Signature



Cascadia offers two verification methods:

**Auto-Link**

After you've signed your message, an option to "Share Verification Link" will appear. This link comes pre-loaded with the signer's address, the message, and its signature.

**Manual Verification**

Get the signer's address, the signed message, and the signature. Enter these details into the Cascadia platform to authenticate the details.



**Successful Verification**: Cascadia will display a confirmation message.

**Failed Verification**: If the details don't align, an error message will appear.

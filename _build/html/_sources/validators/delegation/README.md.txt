# Delegation

The validation of the blocks is delegated to several delegates by stakeholders in Cascadia’s DPoS consensus.  These delegates, also known as witnesses, protect Cascadia on behalf of the stakeholders and are in charge of fostering network consensus when new blocks are being validated.  The delegates that will submit a specific proposal to the stakeholders in order to secure their votes are chosen by the stakeholders via a democratic voting system.  The amount of Cascadia tokens that network users have locked up in their wallets determines the voting power, but the rewards for a successful block validation are split between agents who participate in the network, as described below.

As stakeholders vote based on a candidate’s reputation, DPoS enables improved block validator screening.  Stakeholders have the right to dismiss or substitute alternative witnesses at any moment for unruly or ineffective delegates.

Delegating tokens comes with risks.  When delegating tokens to a validator, you take on a certain level of responsibility for their actions, depending on the number of tokens you've delegated.  It's crucial to research validators thoroughly before delegating to minimize potential risks.&#x20;

# Consumer Relationship Management

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Cascadia Deck_Page_16.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Current CRM systems, like Salesforce, are static models, functioning as sales or customer support tools that manage contact info and email addresses. Cascadia onboards a new category of consumer overlooked by web2 companies into CRM solutions, by treating them as individuals, not as generic groups. Our focus on alignment and user behavior allows for more customized, targeted lead generation. This is valuable not just to web2/web3 companies seeking users, itâ€™s also a positive-sum game for consumers, as good actors are recognized and rewarded industry-wide for positive actions, such as being favored for protocol rewards, exchange rates, or airdrops.

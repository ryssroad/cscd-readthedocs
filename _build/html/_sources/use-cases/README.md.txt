# Use Cases

The cryptocurrency industry currently builds products with a tech-first mindset, resulting in a very unfriendly user experience. This limits the growth of our industry and actual, real-world traction.

By understanding user needs — what drives them, what motivates them — we’re able to encourage positive-sum actions that keep ecosystems healthy, and craft products that will better serve our users, in areas such as marketing, DeFi, and CRM.

Cascadia’s cybernetic structure embraces flexibility-feedback in contract design. Our use cases are complementary and cumulative — ongoing usage enhances subsequent usage.

DeFi is a 10B industry, CRM is a 50B industry, digital marketing is a 500B industry, with double-digit CAGR across all categories. We see all three industries as ripe for disruption, in a way that stays true to web3 values, respecting individual choice, ownership, and privacy.

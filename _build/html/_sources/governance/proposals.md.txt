# Proposals

Proposals are initiated to propose a potential modification to Cascadia via a Cascadia Improvement Proposal (CIP).  Discussions are started as a \[Temperature Check], then moved to \[CIP] and vote, after community feedback and discussion.  The progression from \[Temperature Check] to \[CIP] is a collaborative process.  CIPs are intended to provide a consistent pathway for proposing changes to Cascadia, ensuring that all stakeholders have an opportunity to be heard.



Each CIP must contain:

1. **Title:** This is the title, labelled either \[Temperature Check] or \[CIP].
2. **Author:** Who is proposing the idea?
3. **Summary:** This is a one-sentence summary of the proposal.&#x20;
4. **Background/Motivation:** This is the main body of the proposal.
5. **Specification:** This is what will be implemented should the proposal be approved.
6. **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** How is performance measured?
7. **Reversion**: For how long will this proposal be active before it is automatically reverted based on the stated KPIs?
8. **Voting:** This outlines the voting options.

<h1>Governance<a class="headerlink" href="#governance" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Cascadia’s governance model aims to be an equitable and transparent process, facilitating the inception and realisation of initiatives to improve the network’s sustainability and progress. The on-chain governance system grants bCC holders the agency to influence the project’s course, cultivating a vibrant ecosystem. Cascadia’s governance model is designed with flexibility and adaptability at its core, ensuring it can evolve in response to the dynamic needs of the ecosystem and its participants.</p>
<p><strong>The Role of bCC and the “Alignment” Process</strong></p>
<p>bCC is a specific ERC-20 token that confers voting rights. It is non-transferable and can only be obtained through the alignment of CC. The concept of alignment extends beyond the traditional understanding of locking. In Cascadia, it represents the harmonisation of the contributor’s interests with the long-term vision of the network. By aligning CC, contributors receive bCC, which affords them voting rights in Cascadia’s on-chain governance.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements for Participation</strong></p>
<p>Cascadia’s governance is open to all bCC holders. Whether you choose to propose changes, vote on decisions, or engage in on-chain and off-chain discussions is entirely up to you. The future of Cascadia is shaped by its contributors and the collective actions of those who choose to participate.</p>
<p><strong>How to Acquire and Use bCC</strong></p>
<p>To acquire bCC, users have to align a specified quantity of CC for a set duration. Upon completion of the alignment process, users receive bCC, denoting their voting power in governance matters. bCC can be used to submit governance proposals and vote on existing proposals.</p>
<p><strong>Voting Rights and Restrictions</strong></p>
<p>The voting power of each account is proportional to its bCC balance, ensuring a fair representation of all participant’s interests. Voting rights have certain restrictions. bCC are non-transferable and serve no other purpose than voting. This approach discourages short-term speculation and nurtures an environment where users vote with the long-term health and growth of Cascadia in mind.</p>
<p><strong>Continuous Development</strong></p>
<p>Cascadia’s governance model is designed to be adaptive and flexible, fostering a truly decentralized decision-making process. As the needs and conditions of the network evolve over time, so too will the governance model, mirroring the changes within the community and Cascadia’s broader ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Community’s Role</strong></p>
<p>The foundation for governance as a growing sector lies in societal trends, particularly with growing interdependencies at many different levels and in many different directions. These broad social patterns may be seen as a manifestation of, a response to, or even a catalyst for long-term processes of social differentiation and integration. The validating process is becoming more institutionalized, so continual process of incentive alignment through vote escrowed governance allows us to boost the number of interactions between demand and supply side agents while multiplying the number of holders on-chain.  Every contributor plays a crucial role in the evolution of Cascadia’s governance model. Feedback, innovative ideas, and active involvement are all essential in shaping and improving Cascadia’s governance structure.</p>

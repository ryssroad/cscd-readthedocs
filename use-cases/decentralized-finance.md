Use Case 2: Decentralized Finance.

Currently, due to lack of counterparty trust, DeFi lending protocols require overcollateralization for loans. By observing transaction activity on its native dapps, Cascadia can craft accurate, anonymous credit scores for individual wallets. This enables us to create dynamic loan agreements — different rates for different users. A transparent, opt-in credit score can also be utilized across DeFi to possibly end overcollaterization altogether, significantly expanding DeFi’s TAM by aligning it with real world lending practices.

Users, not platforms, should own their financial history.

# Business Development and Marketing

Use Case 1: Business Development and Marketing.

Companies have issues attracting users. Millions are spent each year on legacy marketing agencies or outdated practices, like indiscriminate airdrops. Cascadia empowers any individual to act as a marketing agent through dynamic smart contracts, which gauge the effectiveness, reach, and sentiment of a user’s social media posts about a project. High quality interactions are incentivized through permissionless token claims. The market opportunity here is tremendous. Disrupting the digital marketing industry by returning sovereignty to individuals has far-reaching implications both inside and outside of web3.

Users, not platforms, should own their personal data.

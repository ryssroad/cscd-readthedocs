# Alignment

As an aligned CC holder, you hold governance authority in the Cascadia ecosystem. This means you have the right to vote on proposals and influence protocol development.



**Step 1: Connect your Wallet.**

Click on the "Connect My Wallet" button.

Follow the prompts to connect your preferred wallet.\
\
\
**Step 2: Align CC to Receive bCC.**\
\
Determine the amount of CC you want to align.  You can select 25%, 50%, 75%, the maximum amount of your available balance, or enter a custom number.

Click the "Approve" button to confirm your selection to initiate the alignment process.

Your bCC balance will update to reflect your new alignment.

{% hint style="info" %}
Alignment may also be increased (realigned).  This process will not reset your Cooldown.
{% endhint %}



**Step 3: Check Alignment and Realigning.**

You can check your level of alignment at any time on the dashboard.  Here you'll see the amount of bCC you currently hold and your alignment as a percentage total bCC.  If you wish to re-affirm your alignment, you can click on the "Realign" button.\
\
\
**Step 4: Claim bCC.**

Click on the "Claim" button on the dashboard.\
\
\
**Step 5: Start a Cooldown.**

Click "Start Cooldown" button to initiate the cooldown process.\
\
\
**Step 6: Withdraw CC.**

Click on the "Withdraw" button to withdraw CC.  You'll receive CC, not bCC.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can withdraw CC after the Cooldown period ends.
{% endhint %}
